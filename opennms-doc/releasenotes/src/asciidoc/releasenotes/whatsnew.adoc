=== Important Upgrade Notes

* All collectors using the `JMXSecureCollector`, `MX4JCollector` or `JBossCollector` must be migrated to use the `Jsr160Collector` instead.
* All monitors using the `JBossMonitor` or `JMXSecureMonitor` must be migrated to use the `Jsr160Monitor` instead.
* All detectors using the `JBossDetector` or `MX4JDetector` must be migrated to use the `Jsr160Detector` instead.
* The configuration of the _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ has changed. Please refer to <<releasenotes-22-opennms-es-rest-properties>>.
* The index creation of the _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ has changed and is now configurable. Please refer to <<releasenotes-22-opennms-es-rest-index-properties>>.
* The _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ no longer supports ElasticSearch version 2.4. A version >= 5.x must be used.

==== Configuration of the _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_

The configuration of the _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ has been changed.
Some properties have new defaults and have been renamed.
It is now also possible to define index settings and provide a index strategy to have more control over the index creation.

===== Changed Properties with new defaults

Some properties of the plugin have changed.
The following table shows the old (no longer supported) and the new property name, as well as the new default, which is used if the configuration is not updated manually.
Please update the configuration file `etc/org.opennms.plugin.elasticsearch.rest.forwarder.cfg` accordingly.
For more details on how to configure the plugin to use elasticsearch refer to link:../guide-admin/index.html#configure-elasticsearch-persistence[Configure ElasticSearch Persistence].

[[releasenotes-22-opennms-es-rest-index-properties]]
===== Index Properties

It is now possible to define index-related properties, e.g. the number of shards and replicas.
It is also possible to define a property  `elasticIndexStrategy` to determine if a `hourly`, `daily`, `monthly` or `yearly` index should be created.
It defaults to `monthly`.

For more details please refer to link:../guide-admin/index.html#configure-elasticsearch-persistence[Configure ElasticSearch Persistence].

=== Breaking Changes

* `JMXSecureCollector`, `MX4JCollector` and `JBossCollector` have been removed. Please use the `Jsr160Collector` instead.
* `JBossMonitor` and `JMXSecureMonitor` have been. Removed. Use the `Jsr160Monitor` instead.
* `JBossDetector` and `MX4JDetector` have been removed. Use the `Jsr160Detector` instead.
* The configuration of the _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ has changed. Please refer to <<releasenotes-22-opennms-es-rest-properties>>.
* The index creation of the _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ has changed and is now configurable. Please refer to <<releasenotes-22-opennms-es-rest-index-properties>>.
* The _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ no longer supports ElasticSearch version 2.4. A version >= 5.x must be used.
* By default the data collection gathered data twice from SNMP agents supporting the MIB-II with 32bit and 64bit counter on network interfaces.
  The default 32bit interface counters are no disabled by default and only 64bit counters are collected.

IMPORTANT: If you have legacy SNMP agents which only support 32bit interface counters, the data collection for this interfaces will stop after you upgraded to 22.0.0.
           To get them enabled, you have to create a data collection package and add the `mib2-interfaces` data collection group manually for this devices with the example below.
