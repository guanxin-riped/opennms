{opennms-product-name} persists/forwards certain data to _Elasticsearch_.
To do so some features must be installed and usually _Elasticsearch_ must be configured properly.

The following chapters describe the configuration possibilities as well as the available features.

TODO MVR put this somewhere:
The _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ uses the Jest library (https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest) to access the _Elasticsearch_ ReST interface.



TODO MVR change anchor accordingly, but ensure references are set correctly
[[configure-elasticsearch-persistence]]
=== Configuration

TODO MVR adjust accordingly, we are no longer in the netflow world, but in a generic world

The _NetFlow 5 Adapter_ persists the data to _ElasticSearch_ and access needs to be configured on the _{opennms-product-name}_ system through _Karaf Console_:

.Minimal configuration to access ElasticSearch

The following configuration properties can be set:

The configuration properties will be stored in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg`.

TIP: If a configuration management tool is used, the properties file can be created and is used as startup configuration

NOTE: If credentials are provided preemptive auth is used for all defined ElasticSearch nodes.

elasticUrl=http://elastic:9200

=== Credentials

It is possible to define credentials for each ElasticSearch node individually.
Credentials for each node must be stored in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/elastic-credentials.xml`.

.Custom credentials
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<elastic-credentials>
    <credentials url="http://localhost:9200" username="ulf" password="ulf" />
    <credentials url="https://10.10.0.1:9333" username="ulf" password="flu" />
</elastic-credentials>
